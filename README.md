# FoodDeliveryOrderTracking

This python program utilizes the stack data structure to monitor incoming orders of a food delivery service like User Eats or DoorDash.

Each driver of this delivery service can only recive 6 orders at a time, so this program notifies the driver of their incoming orders and lets them know when they have reached the maximum amount of orders they can handle - then delivers those orders from the top of the stack.

Included is a test.py file with some print statements to test the functionality of the code
